# 🥫 Komora
**Komora** is a mobile app concept that helps users track their home-canned goods and store their favorite preservation recipes. It also sends reminders when a jar has been stored for too long (e.g., over one year).Designed for home cooks, gardeners, and anyone who loves preserving seasonal produce, **Komora** offers a simple and visual way to manage your pantry.
